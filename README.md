# png
This is an early *work-in-progress* PNG decoder written in the [Monkey programming language](https://github.com/blitz-research/monkey). This module is strictly experimental and is subject to heavy changes; use at your own risk.

This depends on [the 'regal' modules project](https://github.com/Regal-Internet-Brothers/regal-modules), so if you're interested in this, you'll first need to install (And update) those. In addition, this relies on highly experimental functionality located in '[regal.inflate](https://github.com/Regal-Internet-Brothers/inflate)', which is likely not in a sufficient state when you're reading this. An overhaul of the 'inflate' API is likely to happen in the future.
